## Opening a file

You can use the `file` URL argument to specify file to be loaded from the same web server.

You can also drag-and-drop local files onto the file contents area.


## Submitting an XPath expression

If the expression is incorrect, an error message is displayed. Otherwise, the number of selected nodes is displayed, and the nodes themselves are highlighted in yellow in the tree and in the textual rendering.


## Rendering

Click on the tabs at the top to switch between the graphical and textual representations.
